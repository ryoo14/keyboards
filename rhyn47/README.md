## Information

### Manufacturing Notes
When ordering from JLC3DP:
- **Warning alerts**: Several warnings may appear during the ordering process
- **Warping concerns**: Engineers have raised concerns about significant warping when printing the case

When I placed my order, I received the above warnings but accepted the risks and proceeded with manufacturing. The resulting product had no issues.

However, if you decide to place an order, please do so at your own risk and responsibility.
